Use Data Refinery to cleanse and shape tabular data with a graphical flow editor. You can also use interactive templates to code operations, functions, and logical operators. When you cleanse data, you fix or remove data that is incorrect, incomplete, improperly formatted, or duplicated. When you shape data, you customize it by filtering, sorting, combining or removing columns, and performing operations.

The data can be analyzed PDf and CSV
